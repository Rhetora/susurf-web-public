            <h2><strong>How to borrow kit?</strong></h2>
            <p>Wondering how you can borrow a board and a suit from Susurf for your solo adventures? Look no further!</p>
            <h6>You will need a SuSurf Membership to borrow club kit! <a href="https://www.susu.org/groups/susurf" target="_blank">Membership</a></h6>
            <h5 style="padding-top: 2em">Step one</h5>
            <p>Read this guide on borrowing kit and the guide on how to <a href="{% url 'kit:kitCare' %}">look after club kit.</a></p>
            <h5>Step two</h5>
            <p>Decide what you want to borrow, and what sizes you'll need. If you don't have any kit yourself you'll likely need a surfboard, a leash, and a wetsuit.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If you're a beginner you'll want to borrow a foamie! Around 7ft if you're small, up to around 9ft if you're bigger</li>
              <li>The length of the leash should be around the same as the board. Most club leashes are quite long though so don't worry if its not!</li>
              <li>Wetsuits come in S, M, L, XL etc for Men, and 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 etc for Women. For a general size guide check out <a href="https://www.ripcurl.eu/en/help/size-guides.html" target="_blank">this.</a> A "T" suffix means tall, and "S" means short.
            </ul>
            <h5>Step three <strong>(Important!)</strong></h5>
            <p>Once you've decided what you want to borrow, you need to use our kit <a href="{% url 'kit:kitLogout' %}">logout</a> system to mark what you want to borrow. This system has a number of advantages for you.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You can view what's available to borrow. Only items highlighted in green are available, the rest are either too damaged to use or already in use.</li>
              <li>You can see information about all the equipment we have such as sizes, ability range, and more. This should make it easier to find what you want in the container.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To borrow something, simply click the borrow button and thats it! Don't click items you don't want to borrow accidently or you could be marked as responsible for that item. To check whether something is marked as borrowed by you, items with a green "Return" button next to them are currently checked out by you.</p>
            <h5>Step four</h5>
            <p>Next message our kit sec, either by messaging the <a href="{{ facebook }}" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a>, emailing us at info@susurf.co.uk, or messaging the kit sec directly! They will then arrange a time for a committee member to go with you to collect the kit you need.</p>
            <h5>Step five</h5>
            <p>Go collect the kit you borrowed from the container! Our container is located in Wide Lane Sports Ground.</p>
            <div id="googleMap" style="width:100%;height:20em;"></div>
            <h5 style="padding-top:2em;">Step six</h5>
            <p>Once you've finished with the kit, message our kit sec again to arrange to return it. Please return kit as soon as possbile so other people can use it! So unless you're going surfing again in the next few days, please take it back!</p>
            <p>We may need to recall kit if we are running day / weeekend trips as these will always take priority! Otherwise you're welcome to borrow any kit as long as you follow this process.</p>
